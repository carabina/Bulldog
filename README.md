![Bulldog: Json Parser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freesuraj/Bulldog/master/Assets/logo.png)

# Bulldog
Bulldog is a super-fast json parser that will keep attacking until it gets the value you desire, or you give up. Just like a bulldog.

## Why Bulldog?

- ✅ Super-light
- ✅ Easily extendible
- ✅ Can easily traverse through path of a json object to get the final value while ignoring the type of intermediate objects
- ✅ Utilises the apple's JSONSerialization underneath
- ✅ Well tested with 100% test coverage
